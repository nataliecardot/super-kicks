Landing page made with Sass/HTML/CSS

Created as part of a [modern landing page tutorial by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1dz0xRbSJc&ab_channel=TraversyMedia)

### Notes

- Some notable features are usage of `clamp`, `shape-outside` and `shape-margin` for floats, and flex layout `gap`
- Designed with a mobile-first layout to reduce the need for media queries
- Used Live Sass Compiler VS Code extension to compile SCSS to CSS
